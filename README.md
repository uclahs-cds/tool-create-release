This set of reusable workflows manages the complexity of creating and tagging new software releases on GitHub.

## Versioning Standards

These workflows make the following assumptions:

* Versions begin with a digit. This applies whether the project is using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) or not.
* Git tags associated with a version begin with a `v`.

`1.2.3`, `1.alpha`, and `4.2` are all acceptable versions, and will be tagged in git as `v1.2.3`, `v1.alpha`, and `v4.2` respectively.

`alpha`, `one.two`, and `v1.2.3` are **not** acceptable versions.

## Usage

Usage of this tool requires adding three workflows to each calling repository (non-semantic repositories only need two). Complete versions of these workflows can be copied from the [templates/](templates/) directory.

`wf-prepare-release.yaml` is triggered manually (via a `workflow_dispatch`) and takes the following actions:

1. Compute the target version number.
  * Semantic repositories compute the version based on existing tags and user input for the bump type (`major`/`minor`/`patch`) and the prerelease flag.
  * Non-semantic repositories accept the next version as an input.
1. Re-write the `CHANGELOG.md` file to move unreleased changes into a new dated release section.
1. (Optional) Update hardcoded version strings in files passed to `version_files` input.
1. Open a PR listing the target version number and release tag.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
        commit id: " "  tag: "v1" tag: "v1.0.0"
        commit id: "  "
        commit id: "   "

        checkout main
        branch prepare_patch
        commit id: "target: v1.0.1"
```

`wf-finalize-release.yaml`, triggered when a release PR is merged, takes the following actions:

1. Create a new release with auto-generated notes and the target tag.
  * By default the new release is a draft, so no public release or tag are created without user intervention.
1. Optionally, attach a source tarball including all submodules to the new release.
1. Comment on the release PR with a link to the new release.
1. Delete the merged release branch.

```mermaid
    gitGraph
        commit id: " "  tag: "v1" tag: "v1.0.0"
        commit id: "  "
        commit id: "   "

        checkout main
        branch prepare_patch
        commit id: "target: v1.0.1"

        checkout main
        merge prepare_patch tag: "v1.0.1"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `wf-alias-release.yaml` is only applicable for repositories using semantic versioning.

`wf-alias-release.yaml`, triggered when a release is published or deleted, synchronizes the corresponding [major tag alias](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#using-tags-for-release-management) to the highest non-prerelease release tag:

```mermaid
    gitGraph
        commit id: " " tag: "v1.0.0"
        commit id: "  "
        commit id: "   "

        checkout main
        branch prepare_patch
        commit id: "target: v1.0.1"

        checkout main
        merge prepare_patch tag: "v1" tag: "v1.0.1"
```

### README Badges

You can add a badge that links to the release preparation workflow by including one of these Markdown snippets (after replacing `ORG` and `REPO`) to your README:

#### Public Repository
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/uclahs-cds/tool-create-release)](https://github.com/uclahs-cds/tool-create-release/actions/workflows/internal-prepare.yaml)
```
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ORG/REPO)](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yaml)
```

#### Private / Internal Repository
[![Prepare release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Action-Create%20New%20Release-blue)](https://github.com/uclahs-cds/tool-create-release/actions/workflows/internal-prepare.yaml)
```
[![Prepare release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Action-Create%20New%20Release-blue)](https://github.com/ORG/REPO/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yaml)
```

## Parameters

Parameters can be specified using the [`with`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runsstepswith) option.

| Workflow | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `bump_type` | string | yes | Kind of semantic release version to target. Must be one of `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `exact`. Using `exact` requires `exact_version`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `prerelease` | boolean | no | If true, mark the bumped semantic release as a prerelease (only used if `bump_type` is not `exact`). |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `version_files` | string | no | Comma-separated relative paths to files containing hardcoded version strings (see note below). |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `exact_version` | string | no | The exact version to assign to the next release (only used if `bump_type` is `exact`). Must not include a leading `v` - use `1XXXX`, not `v1XXXX`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `changelog` | string | no | Relative path to the CHANGELOG file. Defaults to `./CHANGELOG.md`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone to use when calculating the current date for the CHANGELOG. Defaults to `America/Los_Angeles`. |
| `wf-finalize-release.yaml` | `draft` | boolean | no | If true (the default), mark the new release as a draft and require manual intervention to continue. |
| `wf-finalize-release.yaml` | `attach-tarball` | boolean | no | If true (not the default), attach a tarball of the repository source, including all submodules, to the release. |
| `wf-alias-release.yaml` | `commit-user-name` | string | no | User name to use while tagging new commits (defaults to `github-actions[bot]`) |
| `wf-alias-release.yaml` | `commit-user-email` | string | no | User email to use while tagging new commits (defaults to `41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`) |

All three workflows also accept a `token` secret which is required for full functionality (e.g. CI/CD checks on the opened pull request). The provided [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) should be stored as a secret in the repository and have the following scopes:

* `repo`
* `workflow`

### Updating hard-coded strings with `version_files`

> [!TIP]
> If possible, avoid embedding version numbers in version-controlled files. An alternative is to dynamically generate version numbers during the build or release process - [hatch-vcs](https://github.com/ofek/hatch-vcs) or [setuptools-scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) can do this for python packages.

Hard-coded version strings in files (e.g. in `nextflow.config` or `_version.py` files) can be updated by passing the filepath to the `version_files` input. The update behavior is simple and brittle: every input file must have exactly one line that looks like `version = '1.2.3'` (see the full regex in [`updatefiles.py`](./bumpchanges/updatefiles.py)). Multiple matches or no matches will stop the release.
