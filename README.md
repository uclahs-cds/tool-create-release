# Automations for GitHub Releases

This pair of reusable workflows manage the complexity of creating and tagging new software releases on GitHub.

`wf-prepare-release.yaml` is triggered manually (via a `workflow_dispatch`) and takes the following actions:

1. Compute the target version number based on existing tags and user input for `major`/`minor`/`patch`/`prerelease`.
1. Re-write the `CHANGELOG.md` file to move unreleased changes into a new dated release section.
1. Open a PR listing the target version number and release tag.

`wf-finalize-release.yaml`, triggered when a release PR is merged, takes the following actions:

1. Create a new release with auto-generated notes and the target tag.
  * By default the new release is a draft, so no public release or tag are created without user intervention.
1. Comment on the release PR with a link to the new release.

## Example Usage

Usage of this tool requires adding two workflows to each calling repository:

**`prepare-release.yaml`**

```yaml
---
name: Prepare new release

run-name: Open PR for new ${{ inputs.bump_type }} release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      bump_type:
        type: choice
        description: >-
          Semantic version bump type. Using `exact` is required for repositories
          without semantic version tags and allows specifying the exact next tag
          to use with the `exact_version` argument.
        required: true
        options:
          - major
          - minor
          - patch
          - prerelease
          - exact
      exact_version:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Exact version number to target. Only used if bump_type is set to
          `exact`. Do not include a leading `v`.
        required: false
        default: ''

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  prepare-release:
    uses: uclahs-cds/tool-create-release/.github/workflows/wf-prepare-release.yaml@v1
    with:
      bump_type: ${{ inputs.bump_type }}
      exact_version: ${{ inputs.exact_version }}
    # Secrets are only required until tool-create-release is made public
    secrets: inherit
```

**`finalize-release.yaml`**

```yaml
---
name: Finalize release

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    types:
      - closed

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  finalize-release:
    # This conditional ensures that the reusable workflow is only run for
    # release pull requests. The called workflow repeats these checks.
    if: ${{ github.event.pull_request.merged == true && startsWith(github.event.pull_request.head.ref, 'automation-create-release') }}
    uses: uclahs-cds/tool-create-release/.github/workflows/wf-finalize-release.yaml@v1
    with:
      draft: true
    # Secrets are only required until tool-create-release is made public
    secrets: inherit
```

## Parameters

Parameters can be specified using the [`with`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runsstepswith) option.

| Workflow | Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `bump_type` | string | yes | Kind of semantic release version to target. Must be one of `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `prerelease`, or `exact`. Using `exact` requires `exact_version`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `exact_version` | string | no | The exact version to assign to the next release (only used if `bump_type` is `exact`). Must not include a leading `v` - use `1XXXX`, not `v1XXXX`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `changelog` | string | no | Relative path to the CHANGELOG file. Defaults to `./CHANGELOG.md`. |
| `wf-prepare-release.yaml` | `timezone` | string | no | IANA timezone to use when calculating the current date for the CHANGELOG. Defaults to `America/Los_Angeles`. |
| `wf-finalize-release.yaml` | `draft` | boolean | no | If true (the default), mark the new release as a draft and require manual intervention to continue. |
